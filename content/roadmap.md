### Dashboard — New Entry
Full entry form with date, amount, type, category, and optional note. Staged entries workflow — entries are reviewed before being committed. Starting Funds as a one-time income entry that locks once set.

### Dashboard — Overview
Four summary cards: Income, Savings, Total Expenses, and Flow. Flow is the net result after deducting flow-type savings and expenses from income.

### Expenses by Category
Bar chart breaking down spending across all 12 categories for a selected period. Per-category colours and icons rendered on the chart canvas. Toggleable legend. Period-scoped export and import separate from the global backup.

### Recent Transactions
Reverse-chronological list of all committed entries. Type and context-aware category filters. Full History overlay mode.

### Analytics — Activity Intensity
Day-level heatmaps for spending and earnings. Quartile-based colour levels within the displayed quarter. Quarter and year navigation. Sync toggle keeps both maps on the same period.

### Analytics — Trends
Line chart for income, expenses, savings, and cash flow. Week, month, and quarter granularity covering recent history.

### Analytics — Forecasting
Rolling 12-month budget year projection from a user-selected start month. Weighted average built from historical months — recent months carry more weight. Chart splits at today: solid lines for actuals, dashed for projections. Three-value summary cards: to date, projected remaining, and year-end total.
