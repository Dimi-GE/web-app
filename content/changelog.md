## v0.0.1b — June 2026

- `fix` Loading — per-view spinner replaces the former full-screen overlay; spinner appears inside the content area on first visit to each view and lifts only when the view signals it is fully rendered, preventing content flash across all views
- `fix` Loading — `window.viewReady()` callback introduced; each view's init function calls it at the natural end of its async work (after charts render, sub-components load, and markdown fetches complete) so the spinner duration is tied to actual content readiness rather than a fixed timeout
- `fix` Loading — 350ms fallback timeout added to force-remove the overlay when `transitionend` does not fire; prevents the invisible overlay from blocking pointer events on synchronously-initialised views such as Hours Reports
- `improvement` Loading — load time logged to console per view (`[viewName] ready in Xms`) to aid performance profiling
- `improvement` Loading — 8-second safety timeout auto-dismisses the spinner if a view's init never signals ready, preventing the overlay from hanging indefinitely
- `improvement` Hours Reports — view renamed from Time Tracking across all user-facing labels, navigation, view title, changelog, and roadmap entries; internal file paths unchanged
- `improvement` Hours Reports — Today and This Week sections removed; view now focuses on the monthly calendar and timer only
- `docs` HOME.md added covering KPI row, reference month logic, Spending Trend, Recent Transactions, Expense Breakdown, and Financial Health panels
- `docs` HOURS.md added covering Timesheet Settings, Timer, Calendar, Day Entry Modal, and File Operations

## v0.0.1c.7 — June 2026

- `feature` Settings — Backup All Data action downloads a full snapshot of all dashboard entries, time tracking records, and preferences as a single dated JSON file
- `feature` Settings — Restore from Backup action reads a backup JSON file and replaces all current data; requires a file-picker confirm step before overwriting
- `feature` Hours Reports — month total row added below the calendar showing cumulative hours for the displayed month; updates on every render including month navigation
- `feature` Hours Reports — calendar Export JSON and Import JSON actions for sharing data across devices; export covers all entries and sessions, import does a full replace then re-renders
- `improvement` Hours Reports — Export JSON, Import JSON, and Export PDF buttons consolidated into a collapsible file-ops panel behind a single toggle button, matching the dashboard pattern and fixing overflow on narrow mobile screens
- `improvement` Settings — Backup, Restore, and Reset share a single STORAGE_KEYS array so adding new views keeps all three actions in sync automatically
- `fix` Mobile — `100dvh` added alongside `100vh` on body, window wrapper, and mobile drawer to correct content clipping caused by browser chrome on iOS Safari and Android
- `fix` Loading — full-screen overlay with spinner shown on initial page load, fades out after 2 seconds, preventing section-by-section flash of unstyled content on first paint
- `fix` View transitions — `loadCSS()` converted to return a Promise; HTML is now injected only after the view stylesheet has fully loaded, eliminating per-view flash of unstyled content on first visit

## v0.0.1c.6 — June 2026

- `feature` Mobile navigation — sidebar hidden on touch devices; hamburger button (fixed, top-right) opens a slide-in drawer with full nav labels; backdrop tap closes it

- `improvement` TX_CATEGORY_COLORS, getCategoryColor, TX_TYPE_ICONS, and TX_TYPE_COLORS moved to app.js so they are globally available regardless of which view is active first
